## 0x11. C - printf()

The printf project is a collaboration project by Peters Kimberly and Loice Wafula, students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme by Holberton School, in which a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

### Description

The function ```_printf``` writes output to ```stdout```. The function writes under the control of a ```format``` string that specifies how subsequent arguments (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of standard library ```stdarg```) are converted for output.

Prototype: ```int _printf(const char *format, ...);```
